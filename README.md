# VisionMatrix

In this project, we developed Vision Matrix, an interactive art installation designed to engage users through dynamic visual representations. We utilized a combination of two Raspberry Pis, a PiTFT display, an LED matrix, and a camera to bring this concept to life. The installation captures the intersection of technology and art, transforming real-time video data into interactive displays on an LED matrix.
The Vision Matrix operates through a dual-system setup. The primary Raspberry Pi processes video inputs to create real-time art manifestations such as silhouettes and gesture drawings, which are then displayed on the LED matrix. The secondary Raspberry Pi serves as an interactive control panel via the PiTFT display, allowing uses to select between three mode:
Mirror Mode: Mirrors users' movements and gestures.
Art Mode: Allows users to draw freely and choose colors.
Gallery Mode: Displays a collection of previously saved drawings.


In order to get this done, we broke down our development process into three areas:
Front End: The user interface that facilitates mode selection, enhancing the accessibility and usability of the interactive features.
Back End Processing: Dedicated to the core functionalities of video processing, display outputs, and data storage, ensuring that the artistic representations are both visually appealing and promptly responsive.
Back End Communication Protocol: A framework that allows the communication between the front-end and back-end systems.
